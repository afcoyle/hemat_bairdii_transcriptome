## Description

This folder contains files that describe the samples sent from Pam Jensen to the Roberts Lab after her retirement.

Important notes for the following files:

#### jensen_archived_samples.csv

The Box ID numbers are NOT unique to that box. However, the year/survey/box ID combination is unique.

Standard 96-well plates are assumed to be full unless explicitly noted on the box, and thus the number of samples is set to 96. Boxes that aren't standard 96-well plates have the specific number of samples listed.

Boxes of mixed species/surveys will have their contents noted in another CSV - jensen_archived_mixed_boxes.csv. These are often unlabeled. The survey will be labeled as "mixed", and the Box ID will be (if none exists), mixed_box_#, with # being a sequential number for that tote
