    "In our lab cleaning, I realized that we have an absolute goldmine of samples from Pam Jensen. We have over four full totes of them! Nearly all are in the form of sealed 96-well plates, but there are a few exceptions. Here's a rundown on what we've got:\n",

    "Species: Almost all presumed C. bairdi or C. opilio, but there are a few confirmed to be the following:\n",
    "- Hybrid C. bairdi/C. opilio\n",
    "- C. angulatus (triangle Tanner crab)\n",
    "- C. tanneri (grooved Tanner crab, yes it's confusing that regular Tanner crab aren't C. tanneri)\n",
    "- Paralithodes camtschaticus (red king crab) (!!!!!)\n",

    "- Hyas sp (lyre crabs)\n",
    "- Lithodes couesi (scarlet king crab)\n",

    "Location: Generally they were collected on surveys. Many in the Eastern Bering Sea (EBS) with a good number in SE Alaska, several in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and northern Bering Sea (NBS), and a sprinkling from Newfoundland and Russian waters (Sea of Okhotsk/Chukchi Sea). For many, location is unknown, as boxes are marked only with the project number\n",

    "Sample: Nearly all hemolymph samples, but with a smattering of tissue samples\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we're lacking a great deal of information on nearly all of these samples. Precise collection dates and locations are unknown. For many, even a general collection location is unknown. All individual crab information is completely absent. For the vast majority of these samples, we also do not know whether these crabs were infected by _Hematodinium_. Presumably, these samples were obtained to diagnose the prevalence of _Hematodinium_, and so a good number of them are uninfected.\n",
