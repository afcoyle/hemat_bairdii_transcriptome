## Introduction

We previously performed WGCNA on a series of pairwise comparisons. Notably, we examined individual libraries aligned to our crab transcriptome (cbai_v4.0) for ambient-temperature and elevated-temperature crab over days 0 and 2. 

This WGCNA analysis produced a significant module. We will now examine the composition of that module using GO-MWU.
