## DEG_venn_diagrams:

An outdated folder containing a Venn diagram of the overlap in differentially-expressed accession IDs and sequence IDs between treatment groups

## DEGPatterns_output:
Output from the R package DEGPatterns, which examines expression over time and creates graphs.

## DESeq2_output:

Output from the R package DESeq2, which takes matrices of sequence counts and determines the likelihood that those sequences are differentially expressed between conditions. Importantly, this output contains **all** output from DESeq2, including text files containing descriptions of all genes and DEGs.

## GOMWU_output:

Output from [GO-MWU](https://github.com/z0on/GO_MWU), which performs a rank-based gene ontology analysis. This folder contains hierarchical clustering trees of significant Biological Processes GO categories for a variety of pairwise comparisons.

## paper_figures

Contains figures made specifically for the paper (explanatory figures, etc)
